# Panic Zone - Hackathon

## Introduction

> This game was developed as a challenge for an event called "Hackathon" in <Academia_De_Codigo_> where we had to create an app/webservice/game
in 24 hours, based on a song we were drafted (N.W.A. - F*ck the Police was our drafted track). The game's setting is in a cyberpunk themed future , in a world
where the entire police force is managed by state of the art A.I. and composed of robot cops. This A.I. was struck by a malicious virus though,
causing the cops to go hay-wire, and it's up to the player to neutralize the cops and save humanity from their erratic behaviour.
The game is barely functional at the moment, and most of it's main feature's are missing.
